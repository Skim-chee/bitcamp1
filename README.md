# Myo Defender

This is the assets folder for a project in Unity. 

We created a self-defense tutorial using the Myo-armband. We tried to keep it simple and interactive in terms of UI/UX, and also included Twitter's API to 
send out a tweet upon completion. 
#How does it work?

Using the myo armband, we detected the "pose" the user was holding with their hand (in our case, a fist) and also used the 
accelerometer to detect the direction and acceleration of the users arm. 

Through this, we were able to detect two motions integral to self-defense, <b>Punching</b>, and <b>Blocking</b>.
